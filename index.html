		    This program makes a random walk between two given points, in this case the x and y coordinates of your mouse and the x and y of the center of the canvas. Imagine a line being drawn between the two points, and divide the line up into equal lengths. These points that divides the imaginary line are stored into an array. The y coordinate value changes if the line is roughly horizontal, and the x coordinate changes if the line is roughly vertical. This creates the random "walk". The points are then obtained from the array and multiple lines are used to connect the dots, thus randomly walking between two given points.
