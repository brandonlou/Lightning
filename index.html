		    This program makes a random walk between two given points, in this case the x and y coordinates of your mouse and the x and y of the center of the canvas. Imagine a line being drawn between the two points, and divide the line up into equal lengths. These points where the imaginary line divides is stored into an array. The y coordinate value changes if the line is roughly horizontal, and the x coordinate changes if the line is roughly vertical. This creates the random "walk". To draw this lightning-like image, the points are obtained from the array and multiple lines are used to connect the dots.
